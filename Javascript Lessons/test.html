the first item is in position 0 and can be selected by using []

to write out whole array, dont include []
-------
Below is another way to make an array

var cities = new Array;
cities[0] ="Philly";
cities[1] ="DC";
cities[2] ="NYC";
document.write(cities[0]+" "+cities[2]);

Just like excel except you can also have an "else if"

alert("You're older than me.");}

set a variable and add the parameter for how many times it runs

USE A FOR LOOP when you know how many times you need the loop to run

use a do... while loop and the code will be executed at least once
