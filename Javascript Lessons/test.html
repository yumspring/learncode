<!-- script tags go in same place as css style tags 
always end code with semi-colon

<script type="text/javascript"> 


/* document.write(123456); 
document.write("use double quotes for text");
document.write('single quotes also work');
alert("Hello, welcome to my webpage. Alerts make a pop up tag upon loading");
*/

/* var test= "this is defining a variable";
document.write(test);
*/

// var test =(20*5);
// document.write(test);

/* ------------------Variables
var number1 = 20;
var number2 = 30;
var test = (number1+number2);
if (test>100) {document.write(test)} else{document.write("less")};
*/

//setting a prompt to a variable means the response is set as that variable's value

/* -------------PROMPTS
var name = prompt("What is your name?");
var age = prompt("What is your age?");
var band = prompt("What is your favorite band?");

// \n makes a new line in an alert - place this inside the quotes
alert("Your name is "+name+", your age is "+age+", and your favorite band is "+band);

//--------------- learning ARRAYS

/*var cities is holding a new array being created in this line
the first item is in position 0 and can be selected by using []


var cities = new Array("Philly","DC","NYC");

document.write(cities[0]);

to write out whole array, dont include []
-------
Below is another way to make an array

var cities = new Array;
cities[0] ="Philly";
cities[1] ="DC";
cities[2] ="NYC";
document.write(cities[0]+" "+cities[2]);
*/

/*-------------IF STATEMENTS
if (some condition is true) { then do this } else {do this};

Just like excel except you can also have an "else if"



var age = prompt("What is your age?");

if (age<26) {
alert("You're younger than me.");}
else if (age>26){
alert("You're older than me.");}
else{alert("You're the same age as me.");
};
*/

/*-----------FOR LOOPs
set a variable and add the parameter for how many times it runs

YOU CAN PRINT HTML IN A DOCUMENT.WRITE() tag




var a
for(a=0;a<=9;a++)
{
document.write("a"+" Hello<br />")

}

var cars = new Array("ferrari","BMW","Mercedes")
for(i=0;i<cars.length;i++)
{
document.write(cars[i])

}

*/

/*---------- WHILE LOOP

USE A FOR LOOP when you know how many times you need the loop to run
USE A WHILE LOOP when you're not sure how many times it will run

use a do... while loop and the code will be executed at least once
even if the condition is true.
*/

/*
var i=0;
while(i<=10)
{
	document.write(i+"<br />");
	i=i+1;

}


var cars = new Array("ferrari","BMW","Mercedes")
for(i=0;i<cars.length;i++)
{
document.write(cars[i]+"<br />	")

}


---------------BREAK and CONTINUE in LOOPS

Break allows you to end a loop.
Continue allows you to jump or skip an item in the loop


var i=0;

for (i=0;i<=10;i++)

{
if(i==3)
	{
		continue;
	}
//this skips the number 3
if(i==5)
	{
		break;
	}
//this ends the loop at 5, before printing 5
	document.write("this is loop number "+i+"<br />");
}

---------------FUNCTIONS
Function is a bunch of code stored in a name
*/
/*
function test()
{
	document.write("this is my first function!<br />");
}

test();


Functions can also have parameters.
 return prints the value of a variable


function test(x,y)
{

z=x+y;
return z

}

alert(test(2,3));


---------------- METHODS AND PROPERTIES

Properties are the values associated with an object.
.length is a property that returns the length of a string

Methods are the actions that can be performed on objects.
methods are used in the same way as properties with a period, but they have parentheses
like functions. Methods are kind of like built in functions

var x = "victor"

document.write(x.length);
document.write(x.toUpperCase());
document.write(x.fontcolor("red"));
